     When requested to review a manuscript, we ask you to consider three things:
    </p>
    <ul class="c16 lst-kix_list_1-0">
     <li>
      <p class="c6 c13 li-bullet-0">
       You have the expertise and experience that is needed to evaluate the manuscript thoughtfully. It may be best to pass if you feel that you are not qualified to comment on the methodological or statistical techniques used in the manuscript or the overall contribution to the field.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p class="c6 c13 li-bullet-0">
       You have the ability to provide a fair and unbiased review. In the case of a conflict of interest with the manuscript or its authors (please see
        <a class="c12" href="https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/policies/#Competing-interests">Seismica's Competing Interests policy</a> 
       for more details), or of a close personal/working relationship with the authors, the Handling Editor should be informed via email or via the review invitation system. Please contact the Editor if you are unsure of whether you have a Competing Interest.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p class="c6 c13 li-bullet-0">
       You have sufficient time to dedicate to the review. If you feel that you cannot complete a peer review in the requested time (default expectation is within 4 weeks for all submissions to Seismica, excluding Fast Reports), please inform the Handling Editor as soon as possible so that another reviewer can be found promptly.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c6">
     If you cannot satisfy the above criteria, and cannot complete the peer review, then please inform the Handling Editor as soon as possible so that another reviewer can be found promptly. Seismica will be very grateful if you can suggest other reviewers.
    </p>
    <p class="c6">
     As a default, potential reviewers are given two weeks to respond to peer-review invitations.

     Seismica does not use a structured review form. The following sections provide some guidance on information to include and questions to consider in writing your review, which can be uploaded to the journal website as a PDF or copy-pasted into a text box when you are ready to submit it. Any format is fine as long as reviews are clear and respectful. Reviewers may also upload marked up copies of the manuscript file (remember to strip any personal identification from the file before uploading it if you are not signing your review)
    </p>
    <p class="c6">
     Reviewers should inform the handling Editor if a manuscript contains or appears to contain plagiarism or falsified or manipulated data, or if there are any strong similarities between the submitted manuscript and another either published or under consideration by a different journal.  If necessary, provide a companion or similar paper for reference during the review process.
    </p>
    <p class="c6">
     Clearly explain and support your judgements so that editors and authors may understand the basis of your comments and provide reference to additional published works, where appropriate.
    </p>
    <p class="c6">
     Authors should explain the data sources and codes used to generate the results. Reviewers should verify that these are accessible, sufficiently well documented, and self-contained. Anonymized submissions may withhold access to data and codes that might inadvertently reveal the identity of the authors. In this case, the handling Editor will verify that codes and data are accessible.
    </p>
    <p class="c6">
     Since Seismica will be relying on volunteer copy editors from the community, any typos or grammatical issues that the reviewers can flag will be greatly appreciated. However, these issues should not form the main objectives of the peer review reporting. Any technical comments/suggestions can be appended during typesetting.
    </p>
    <p class="c6">
     With the exception of fast reports, reviewers will be asked to return reviews in 4 weeks. The journal aims to return the first decision in 8 weeks, but will not rush decisions at the expense of the scientific process (e.g. giving reviewers more time in case of delays, requiring a third review if appropriate, or calling in a new reviewer in the case of non-response from a previously agreed reviewer). Fast reports ask for reviews in 2 weeks and aim for the first decision in 4 weeks.  It is the responsibility of reviewers to contact the handling editor with any anticipated delays.  Don't neglect to communicate holiday-related absences as these are internationally variable and may not be obvious to other colleagues at Seismica. If the manuscript is accepted, then peer review reports (anonymous if the review is not signed) and rebuttal letters will be published online, alongside the published paper.
