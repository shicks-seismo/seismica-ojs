These are typically from 3,000 to 10,000 words in length (excluding references and figure captions), and can address any aspect of seismology and earthquake science within the journal’s scope (see above). Authors who have long articles of over 10,000 words that cannot be shortened should contact the <u><a class="c15" href="https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/about/editorialTeam">Executive Editor for Production</a></u> ahead of submission to see if this can be accommodated.</p><p class="c4"><strong>Reports</strong><strong>,</strong> which contribute peer-reviewed useful information to the public sphere but may not represent a substantive advance in understanding in themselves. Reports include:</p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_53oe4lno8t2v-0 start"><li><p class="c4 c21 li-bullet-0"><strong>Null results / failed experiments</strong><strong>: </strong>While null results are often ignored in the scientific literature, they can be useful in advancing science, for instance through highlighting difficulties in reproducing published results or by documenting the circumstances in which particular methods or approaches may be unsuccessful. Due to the lack of editorial interest and the difficulty in defining the value of negative results, very few journals offer the possibility for such publications.  <em>Seismica </em>is willing to consider publications of null results <strong>where they are illuminating or instructive in the context of previous published studies</strong><strong>.</strong> Null-result manuscripts should include sections on: the background to the study, methods, details of the null results, discussion of the null results in the context of previous work, and scientific and/or technical insights drawn from the null results. This last element is essential for a good null-result report  – the insights presented there should serve as a ‘take-home message’ for other researchers in that field.</p></li><li><p class="c4 c21 li-bullet-0"><strong>Fast Reports</strong><strong>: </strong><em>Fast Reports</em> are high quality, short, and time-sensitive manuscripts. A key focus will be the first report of a recent earthquake, swarm, or other event (typically submitted within 3-4 weeks after its occurrence or of data collection from that event). An earthquake report may include: original observations and ground motion recordings, source inversions, felt reports and impacts on the built environment, or secondary hazard assessments (<em>e.g</em>., tsunami, landslides). However, submissions offering little more than information routinely provided by earthquake monitoring agencies (e.g. USGS, Geoscope, EMSC) will not be considered. <em>Fast Reports</em> will also consider other studies of a time-sensitive nature, including reanalysis or review of a previous study or lesser known event, proof of concept studies, application of models/techniques, hypothesis validation, and new and/or revised models within the scope of <em>Seismica</em>.  <em>Fast Reports </em>also welcomes articles that could be perceived critical and urgent for science strategy, policies or standards (<em>e.g.</em>, building codes) and topics that could be of interest to the seismology community.<em> Fast Reports </em>go through an accelerated review process.</p></li><li><p class="c4 c21 li-bullet-0"><strong>Software Reports</strong><strong>: </strong>The goals of <em>Software Reports</em> in Seismica are to document new codes, to facilitate community use of them, and to ensure reproducibility of their outputs. <em>Software Reports</em> should include a main paper, plus a user manual and source code that should be uploaded to a public domain repository. The main paper should describe the scientific context, the methods employed, and detail aspects such as test case simulations, model verification, evaluation and performance. Including the examples and test cases mentioned in the main paper as tutorials within the repository is strongly recommended. All code repositories must be privately accessible by the editors and reviewers upon submission, publicly accessible upon acceptance, and the codes included are subject to peer review. See  <u><a class="c15" href="https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/policies#availability-of-data-materials-and-codes">Availability of data, materials, and code</a></u> for more information.</p></li><li><p class="c4 c21 li-bullet-0"><strong>Instrument Deployment and Field Campaign Reports</strong><strong>: </strong><em>Instrument Deployment Reports</em> and <em>Field Campaign Reports</em> allow seismological and other field data collection (e.g., logging a paleoseismic trench or collecting photogrammetric data) to be documented via a citable and peer-reviewed reference that describes the data collected, the experiment design, and relevant collaborators. Ideally these manuscripts should be submitted as soon as possible – i.e., after the instruments and/or data are recovered, and initial data quality assurance (e.g., noise analysis) is completed. Datasets must be publicly available or be made available within two years via a public domain data repository such as the IRIS Data Management Center or Zenodo. If the data are embargoed, then the end date of the embargo and the repository for the data must be stated in the article. Reports are constructed given a specific structure: Scientific background and motivation; Description of the instrument deployment or field experiment (including technical details of the instrumentation, such as instrument response, make and model, etc.); Description of obtained data (including repository details), Preliminary observations and interpretations. For rapid, temporary deployments or experiments, the Editorial process will follow that of <em>Fast Reports</em>.</p></li></ul><p class="c4"><strong>Opinion articles and revi</strong><strong>ews,</strong> which are invited papers about a scientific idea, controversial topics and/or innovative concepts.

A preprint is an author’s original version of a research manuscript prior to formal peer review at a journal, which is deposited on a public server. Seismica encourages posting of preprints on any channel of the authors’ choice, including preprint servers, authors’ or institutional websites. </p><p class="c11">Preprints may be posted and shared at any time during the peer-review process.

Guidance may also be given on whether the manuscript may be submitted as a different publication type (see <u><a class="c15" href="https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/policies#publication-types">Publication types</a></u>).</p><p class="c4 c25">Manuscripts judged to be of potential interest to our readership are sent for formal review, typically to 2 reviewers, although additional reviewers may be sought if found necessary by the handling editor(s). For Fast Reports, one external reviewer (along with the editor’s evaluation) may be sufficient.</p><p class="c4 c25">Editorial decisions should not be a matter of counting votes or numerical rank assessments. Instead, editors will evaluate the strength of the arguments raised by each reviewer and by the authors.</p><p class="c4 c25">Editors may return documents to reviewers or authors before sharing further, if the review or response requires moderation in language, tone, or similar. Seismica does not tolerate inappropriate language in reviews or author responses. </p><p class="c4 c25">Decisions available to editors are ‘accept’, ‘return to author for minor revision’, ‘return to author for major revision’, or ‘reject’. There are no strict timelines enforced on authors for revision. In the case of rejection, guidance will be given on possible actions for the authors, but it is unlikely that the manuscript will become suitable for Seismica (if it is, ‘major revision’ should be used).  </p><p class="c4 c25">Although strict timelines are not applied to revisions, if a paper has been awaiting revision for 6 months, the handling editor should get in touch with the authors to see whether they plan to submit a revision, or if the manuscript should be removed from the system. </p><p class="c4 c25">After the first round of review, Editors may return to reviewers for further advice, particularly in cases where reviewers disagree with each other or where the authors believe they have been misunderstood on points of fact. Typically, authors and reviewers can expect that ‘major revision’ means that another round of external review is probably required, while ‘minor revision’ means that it is unlikely that the paper will be sent for further external review. In the case of a revised manuscript being sent for further external review, it may be sent to either the previous and/or new reviewers. </p><p class="c4 c25">All reviewer reports/editorial decisions should be shared amongst all reviewers of a manuscript.</p><p class="c4 c25">Seismica does not release referees’ identities to authors or to other reviewers unless a referee voluntarily signs their comments to the authors. </p><p class="c4 c25">Seismica offers a double anonymous peer review option. Authors who choose this option at submission will be given the same respectful consideration and will remain anonymous to the referees throughout the consideration process. The authors are responsible for anonymizing their manuscript accordingly (see the <u><a class="c15" href="https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/author-guidelines#submission-and-formatting-checklist">Submission and formatting checklist</a></u>).</p><p class="c4 c25">Seismica uses a transparent peer-review system, where we publish the reviewer comments to the authors and author rebuttal letters of revised versions of our published research articles, as well as the editorial decision letters. Referees will be anonymous if the referees have not released their identities to the authors.</p><p class="c4 c25">With the exception of Fast Reports, reviewers will be asked to return reviews in 4 weeks. The journal aims to return first decision in 8 weeks, but will not rush decisions at the expense of scientific process (e.g. giving reviewers more time in case of delays, requiring a third review if appropriate, or calling in a new reviewer in the case of non-response from a previously agreed reviewer). Fast Reports ask for reviews in 2 weeks and aim for a first decision in 4 weeks.  </p><p class="c4 c25">Seismica aims to maintain communication between editors and authors throughout the publication process. This includes progress updates, explanation of any delays, and explanation and guidance around all decisions made about the paper.</p></div></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header" id="availability-of-data-materials-and-codes"><h2 class="mb-0"><button aria-controls="availability-of-data-materials-and-codes" aria-expanded="false" class="btn btn-lg btn-light btn-block collapsed" data-target="#availability-of-data-materials-and-codes" data-toggle="collapse" type="button"><span class="pull-left">Availability of data, materials, and codes</span></button></h2></div><div aria-labelledby="availability-of-data-materials-and-codes" class="collapse" data-parent="#acc_editorial-policies" id="availability-of-data-materials-and-codes"><div class="card-body"><p class="c4">An important aspect of advancing the field is the reproducibility of scientific results and the verifiability of claims made in a manuscript. Data, codes, and other materials that form the basis of a study must therefore be accessible and understandable. Authors are expected to act in the spirit of Open Science and make their data/codes available when publishing with Seismica. In the following section, we lay out Seismica’s philosophy for ensuring data availability. For best practices to comply with this philosophy, see the <u><a class="c15" href="https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/author-guidelines#submission-and-formatting-checklist">Submission and formatting checklist</a></u>.</p><p class="c4 c25"><strong>Digital data.</strong>In the majority of cases, data analyzed in a given study comes in a digital form. Examples include seismometer and GNSS time series, laboratory sensor readings, and satellite imagery. If the data are derived from a long-term public repository, such as the IRIS DMC, it often suffices to refer to this public data source (with a relevant citation). In the case of substantial data processing efforts (such as computing cross-correlation stacks or Insar imagery), it can be helpful to others to store the processed data in a separate public repository. Seismica requires that any data repository be DOI citable and guarantees long-term archiving. Examples of archiving services that satisfy these requirements are Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GFZ data services (among others; see the <u><a class="c15" href="https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/author-guidelines#submission-and-formatting-checklist">Submiss</a></u><u><a class="c15" href="https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/author-guidelines#submission-and-formatting-checklist">ion and formatting checklist</a></u>). Institutional services, personal websites, and GitHub typically do not meet the standards for long-term, DOI citable archiving. Authors are invited to reach out to one of Seismica’s editors for inquiries and assistance regarding data availability.</p><p class="c4">For any type of data, metadata and documentation are critical for the correct interpretation of the data. Contained within the data repository should be a readme file or other forms of documentation explaining how the data files should be read, what kinds of data they contain, and any metadata associated with them. Ideally, scripts are provided that demonstrate how to properly access the data files. In the case of CSV files and other human-readable formats, it often suffices to merely explain the different columns, whereas binary files and specialized file formats require substantially more details to be accessible and interpretable. It is strongly recommended to use non-proprietary or cross-platform compatible file formats.</p><p class="c4">With the continuing advancement of computational and instrumental resources, data volumes become increasingly larger. Particularly for large-N seismic arrays (e.g. Distributed Acoustic Sensing arrays) and high-resolution supercomputing, the volume of raw data produced often exceeds several Terabytes. It may be impractical or infeasible to make all of these data publicly available. In such cases, authors are expected to make available the derived products from which the claims made in a study can be verified. For example, while it may be infeasible to archive the raw data recorded by a large-N nodal array deployed for microseismicity detection, the catalog of microseismic detections, template waveforms used in template matching, and extracted data of selected seismic events fall within the range of public archiving possibilities.</p><p class="c4">In the case of (potentially) privacy-sensitive data, such as data derived from Raspberry Shake seismometers placed in houses, drone imagery in urban areas, and public enquiries, the authors should take care to safeguard the privacy of individuals who did not consent to making the data available. In the examples given above, authors could consider masking segments of data, or applying differential privacy algorithms (even when only aggregated statistics are presented).</p><p class="c4">For proprietary and embargoed data, see the corresponding subsection below.</p><p class="c4 c25"><strong>Codes and scripts. </strong>Seismica requests authors to not only provide access to their data, but also to the scripts and computer codes that were used to process and analyze these data. The most convenient way to meet this requirement is to combine the data and the corresponding scripts/codes in the same self-contained repository. Seismica recognizes that not all computer codes or scripts are central to a study, but codes or scripts that are important should be provided with clear documentation, or a compelling explanation for their absence. In the case of specialized hardware requirements, it suffices to provide the relevant codes with an additional note on the hardware restrictions.</p><p class="c4">There are various degrees of rigor to which one can document and present their codes, but the minimum requirement that all codes should meet is that they can be executed to reproduce the results presented in the manuscript upon following the instructions presented in the documentation.</p><p class="c4">GitHub and other code repositories are convenient for code sharing, documentation, and collaboration, but they do not provide a DOI. This is because DOIs are intended to be associated with “frozen” content (i.e. content that does not change over time), while many code platforms facilitate dynamic repositories that may undergo active maintenance and development. Since the results of a study do not evolve along with changes in the code, this could lead to incompatibilities between the claims made in a study and the results obtained from running a code. To get the best of both worlds, authors should consider uploading a static copy of their code to a long-term archiving repository while also mentioning in the manuscript where the latest version of the code can be found (and possibly the exact version that was used in the study).</p><p class="c4 c25"><strong>Other materials. </strong>A wide range of potential types and formats of data, samples, records and analytical reference standards may be associated with papers in Seismica for which there are no widely used accessible repositories.  In these cases, authors are urged to make the supporting materials freely available for download if appropriate.  Physical samples should be adequately cataloged in long-term storage and access, with instructions on how to query or access the samples.   Authors should also note if samples were completely consumed or destroyed during analysis.   </p><p class="c4 c25"><strong>Proprietary and embargoed data. </strong>Even though restricted data access goes against the Open Science philosophy, there are sometimes additional restrictions that prevent one from making datasets publicly available. The possible reasons for this are diverse, ranging from geopolitical conditions to corporate non-disclosure agreements to privacy regulations. When access to (part of) the data is restricted, the authors should discuss this with an editor to find an appropriate solution. In some cases derived data (earthquake catalogs, inferred velocity models, simulation output) do not fall under the same restrictions and can be shared in accordance with Seismica policies. When important data cannot be made available, a statement should be included in the manuscript explaining why the data have not been made available.</p><p class="c4">When data falls under an embargo, the data availability statement should indicate when the embargo expires. Many data archiving services (like Zenodo and Figshare) offer various embargo options. In this way, the authors can prepare their datasets as they usually would and let the archiving service automatically handle the embargo expiration.</p><p class="c4 c25"><strong>Data availability for peer review. </strong>To verify the claims made in a study, reviewers should have access to any data, codes, and other materials and be able to properly review them. While an in-depth review of these additional materials is not required, we ask reviewers to verify that the data policies set out in this section are met (see <u><a class="c15" href="https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/reviewer-guidelines#the-process-of-peerreview">Reviewer Guidelines on peer review</a></u>). To facilitate this, authors are expected to prepare their data/code repositories prior to submission. The authors can choose to make these repositories publicly available upon submission, or to provide a private link to be used for peer-review. As any other materials and information, this private link and the contents of the repository fall under the reviewer confidentiality agreements, and will not be shared outside of the peer-review process.</p></div></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header" id="corrections-retractions-and-commentaries"><h2 class="mb-0"><button aria-controls="corrections-retractions-and-commentaries" aria-expanded="false" class="btn btn-lg btn-light btn-block collapsed" data-target="#corrections-retractions-and-commentaries" data-toggle="collapse" type="button"><span class="pull-left">Corrections, retractions, and commentaries</span></button></h2></div><div aria-labelledby="corrections-retractions-and-commentaries" class="collapse" data-parent="#acc_editorial-policies" id="corrections-retractions-and-commentaries"><div class="card-body"><p class="c4"><strong>Corrections.</strong> An Author Correction may be submitted and published to correct any error(s) made in the original published article that affects its scientific accuracy and/or reproducibility or the publication record/metadata. Publication of an Author Correction may be requested by the original author(s) or solicited by a handling editor. In the case that corrections are requested by the author(s), a handling editor will be assigned who will assess the nature of the request and whether the publication of an Author Correction is warranted. If the nature of the correction results in significant changes to the conclusions, interpretations, or integrity of the original paper, the editor may choose instead to retract the paper, whilst reserving the potential to invite the author(s) to resubmit for additional peer review.</p><p class="c4"><strong>Retractions.</strong> Retraction is typically reserved for cases when these issues rise to the level of casting significant doubt on, or resulting in fundamental changes to, the central conclusions and interpretations of a peer-reviewed publication. Violation of publication or research ethics may also result in a study’s retraction, including conflicts of interest that were not disclosed at the time of review. For a more detailed discussion of issues that may lead to retraction, please refer to the <u><a class="c15" href="https://publicationethics.org/files/cope-retraction-guidelines-v2.pdf">Committee on Publication Ethics report</a></u>, which Seismica will follow. In the case of retraction, the original article will be clearly marked as retracted on the article landing page and watermarked in the associated PDF. A detailed justification for the retraction will also be included along with a timeline of all decisions made on the article. Retraction statements will typically include a statement of assent or dissent from the authors. In the event that the issues leading to a publication’s retraction are determined by the editorial board to have resulted from good faith errors on the part of the author(s), an invitation to submit a revised version of the work for additional peer review may be extended. Should that revised version eventually be accepted for publication, it will be treated as a separate entity from the original (e.g., with a new DOI), although the two versions will remain linked. By clicking the Crossmark button, readers can view the Crossmark record for that article, with details of all formal amendments and corrections. If retraction is due to the result of unethical action (including but not limited to plagiarism, failure to notify coauthors, fabrication of data, omission of data, etc), then an invitation to submit a revised version will not be extended.</p><p class="c4"><strong>Expression of Concern.</strong> An Editorial Expression of Concern is a statement from the editors alerting readers to serious concerns affecting the integrity of the published paper. Such expressions indicate that either the editors or the original author(s) have potentially identified a major issue with the published paper, and are actively working to address the problem. The Expression of Concern will remain publicly visible until one of three conditions is met: (1) the editors become satisfied that the issue identified does not require any additional action and the paper may remain published in its current state; (2) a suitable Author Correction is produced and published alongside the original paper; or (3) the issue identified as a concern is deemed sufficiently critical that the central conclusions and/or interpretations of the publication are impacted, at which point the publication may be retracted. The purpose of the editorial expression of concern is to minimize potential damages whilst a publication is being investigated by the editorial board.</p><p class="c4"><strong>Commentaries.</strong> Formal post-publication <strong>Comments</strong> on published papers from author(s) not involved in the original study can involve challenges, clarifications, or, in some cases, an attempt at replication of the published work. After successful peer review, these comments may be published online, usually alongside a <strong>Reply</strong> from the original authors. Comments and replies are limited to 3,000 words and 3 figures each. There is no specific time frame limiting the submission of comments. Those interested in publishing a comment related to an article in Seismica should contact the editorial board, who will then assess the relevance and timeliness of the anticipated comment. Comments are always published at the discretion of the editorial board. After a comment has been peer reviewed and approved by the editors for publication, the original authors of the publication will be invited to submit a reply. Ideally, the comment and subsequent reply will be published simultaneously following peer review, and to facilitate this we place a deadline for submission of the reply at 3 months after the authors of the original publication receive the comment and an invitation to construct a reply. If this deadline is not met, then the comment will be published in isolation. If the author(s) or the original article do not meet this deadline, they may still construct a reply at any point after publication of the prompting comment.</p></div></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header" id="appeals"><h2 class="mb-0"><button aria-controls="appeals" aria-expanded="false" class="btn btn-lg btn-light btn-block collapsed" data-target="#appeals" data-toggle="collapse" type="button"><span class="pull-left">Appeals</span></button></h2></div><div aria-labelledby="appeals" class="collapse" data-parent="#acc_editorial-policies" id="appeals"><div class="card-body"><p class="c4" id="h.1ci93xb">The editorial process shall be managed to the best of the Editors’ abilities with integrity, clarity, respect, and transparency. However, disagreements and complaints regarding editorial decisions and process may sometimes arise. Appeals of any editorial decisions should be written as a detailed and respectful covering letter which should be emailed in pdf format to <u><em><a class="c15" href="mailto:appeals@seismica.org">appeals@seismica.org</a></em></u>. An executive editor will then assume the case and may take one of two possible actions: (1) the executive editor may render a decision on the appeal in the event that they have sufficient disciplinary expertise to appropriately assess the article and the arguments being made by the author(s); or (2) the executive editor may convene a committee of three members from the editorial board to conduct a formal assessment of the appeal. This Appeal Adjudication Committee will be made privy to all communications and reviews concerning the manuscript under appeal. Following consideration of the manuscript and reviews in light of the handling editor’s decision, the Appeal Adjudication Committee may take one of three actions as a result of a majority vote, the tally of which will be kept confidential. (1) They may confirm the decision of the original handling editor. (2) They may overrule the decision of the original handling editor, and request a new handling editor to restart the review process. (3) They may overrule the decision of the original handling editor by requesting revisions be submitted by the author(s). If revisions are requested by the Appeal Adjudication Committee, a new handling editor may be selected from the Seismica board or the committee chair may become the new handling editor.</p><p class="c4" id="h.2bn6wsx">The goal of this thorough approach is to provide an assessment of author appeals/complaints in a neutral environment and to eventually provide the author(s) with closure and constructive feedback. Thus, the original handling editor is not involved in the appeals process. The original handling editor will of course learn the results of the appeals process, but they will not know which members of the editorial board served on the appeals committee nor how they voted in decision. All decisions rendered by the Appeal Adjudication Committee for a particular manuscript are final. Further appeals will not be considered. </p></div></div></div></div><h1>Guidelines for authors</h1><div class="accordion" id="acc_guidelines-for-authors"><div class="card"><div class="card-header" id="scope"><h2 class="mb-0"><button aria-controls="scope" aria-expanded="false" class="btn btn-lg btn-light btn-block collapsed" data-target="#scope" data-toggle="collapse" type="button"><span class="pull-left">Scope</span></button></h2></div><div aria-labelledby="scope" class="collapse" data-parent="#acc_guidelines-for-authors" id="scope"><div class="card-body"><p class="c4">Seismica’s scope includes a wide range of topics in seismological and earthquake sciences.

These are typically from 3,000 to 10,000 words in length (excluding references and figure captions), and can address any aspect of seismology and earthquake science within the journal’s scope (see above). Authors who have long articles of over 10,000 words that cannot be shortened should contact the <u><a class="c15" href="https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/about/editorialTeam">Executive Editor for Production</a></u> ahead of submission to see if this can be accommodated.</p><p class="c4"><strong>Reports</strong><strong>,</strong> which contribute peer-reviewed useful information to the public sphere but may not represent a substantive advance in understanding in themselves. Reports include:</p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_53oe4lno8t2v-0 start"><li><p class="c4 c21 li-bullet-0"><strong>Null results / failed experiments</strong><strong>: </strong>While null results are often ignored in the scientific literature, they can be useful in advancing science, for instance through highlighting difficulties in reproducing published results or by documenting the circumstances in which particular methods or approaches may be unsuccessful. Due to the lack of editorial interest and the difficulty in defining the value of negative results, very few journals offer the possibility for such publications.  <em>Seismica </em>is willing to consider publications of null results <strong>where they are illuminating or instructive in the context of previous published studies</strong><strong>.</strong> Null-result manuscripts should include sections on: the background to the study, methods, details of the null results, discussion of the null results in the context of previous work, and scientific and/or technical insights drawn from the null results. This last element is essential for a good null-result report  – the insights presented there should serve as a ‘take-home message’ for other researchers in that field.</p></li><li><p class="c4 c21 li-bullet-0"><strong>Fast Reports</strong><strong>: </strong><em>Fast Reports</em> are high quality, short, and time-sensitive manuscripts. A key focus will be the first report of a recent earthquake, swarm, or other event (typically submitted within 3-4 weeks after its occurrence or of data collection from that event). An earthquake report may include: original observations and ground motion recordings, source inversions, felt reports and impacts on the built environment, or secondary hazard assessments (<em>e.g</em>., tsunami, landslides). However, submissions offering little more than information routinely provided by earthquake monitoring agencies (e.g. USGS, Geoscope, EMSC) will not be considered. <em>Fast Reports</em> will also consider other studies of a time-sensitive nature, including reanalysis or review of a previous study or lesser known event, proof of concept studies, application of models/techniques, hypothesis validation, and new and/or revised models within the scope of <em>Seismica</em>.  <em>Fast Reports </em>also welcomes articles that could be perceived critical and urgent for science strategy, policies or standards (<em>e.g.</em>, building codes) and topics that could be of interest to the seismology community.<em> Fast Reports </em>go through an accelerated review process.</p></li><li><p class="c4 c21 li-bullet-0"><strong>Software Reports</strong><strong>: </strong>The goals of <em>Software Reports</em> in Seismica are to document new codes, to facilitate community use of them, and to ensure reproducibility of their outputs. <em>Software Reports</em> should include a main paper, plus a user manual and source code that should be uploaded to a public domain repository. The main paper should describe the scientific context, the methods employed, and detail aspects such as test case simulations, model verification, evaluation and performance. Including the examples and test cases mentioned in the main paper as tutorials within the repository is strongly recommended. All code repositories must be privately accessible by the editors and reviewers upon submission, publicly accessible upon acceptance, and the codes included are subject to peer review.

Ideally these manuscripts should be submitted as soon as possible – i.e., after the instruments and/or data are recovered, and initial data quality assurance (e.g., noise analysis) is completed. Datasets must be publicly available or be made available within two years via a public domain data repository such as the IRIS Data Management Center or Zenodo. If the data are embargoed, then the end date of the embargo and the repository for the data must be stated in the article. Reports are constructed given a specific structure: Scientific background and motivation; Description of the instrument deployment or field experiment (including technical details of the instrumentation, such as instrument response, make and model, etc.); Description of obtained data (including repository details), Preliminary observations and interpretations.

Tables can be created in Word's table environment and embedded in the manuscript or uploaded as a separate document (e.g.,  .xls file). Since Seismica is relying on volunteers from the community to typeset the articles, any table that is included in Supplementary Material instead of in the main text will be greatly appreciated. </p></li><li><p class="c4 c5 li-bullet-0"><strong>Abstract.</strong> The English-language abstract should be no more than 200 words, and should not include references within the text</p></li><li><p class="c4 c5 li-bullet-0"><strong>Additional language abstract.</strong> Authors are encouraged to include, in addition to the English version of the abstract, up to two additional language translations of the abstract to be included in the typeset paper, also with a maximum of 200 words each.  Please note that the additional-language abstract may undergo a technical review at the discretion of the Handling Editor.  Seismica does not guarantee reviews of additional language abstracts, so it is the responsibility of the authors to ensure correct translation. Please contact Seismica editors if more than two translated abstracts are desired. </p></li><li><p class="c4 c5 li-bullet-0"><strong>Non-technical summary.</strong> To make your research accessible for everyone, Seismica encourages the inclusion of a non-technical summary with the initial manuscript. In principle, a non-technical summary should explain the essential methods and results of your article so that someone unfamiliar with your field of research can understand. The target audience may include journalists, government staff, other researchers, people involved in civil protection and disaster management, and the public in general. Your non-technical summary should be one or two paragraphs (about 200 words total), covering the following main points:</p></li><ul class="c7 lst-kix_dsywgi4ml8un-2 start"><li><p class="c4 c25 c38 li-bullet-0">What is the current issue or problem that your research addresses, and why are you researching it?

Post-acceptance, if authors choose to submit their article as a .tex file, the corresponding .bib file should also contain only the references that are cited in the main text. The <u><a class="c15" href="https://ctan.org/pkg/bibtools">aux2bib tool in bibtools</a></u> can be used to ensure that a bib file exactly matches a tex file.</p></li><li><p class="c4 c5 li-bullet-0"><strong>Author contributions statement. </strong>The manuscript should contain a short statement stating who did what using the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (<u><a class="c15" href="https://casrai.org/credit/">CRediT</a></u>).

Authors are requested to make data and codes freely available wherever possible. Links to repositories for both data and code can be shared during submission, and made public post-acceptance. The manuscript must include a "data availability" statement. Statements along the lines of “please contact the authors for data access” are not acceptable for data which could be distributed digitally. If the data are not available, the data availability statement should explain why.<br/><br/>Authors should archive data and code in public repositories when appropriate forums exist. Physical samples should be adequately cataloged with curation to insure access for the long-term. Where the study has used data from a seismic network, the full <u><a class="c15" href="https://www.fdsn.org/networks/">FDSN citation</a></u> should be given if it exists. Examples of open-access, DOI citable repositories for data and code include <u><a class="c15" href="https://figshare.com/">Figshare</a></u>, <u><a class="c15" href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a></u>, <u><a class="c15" href="https://datadryad.org/stash">Dryad</a></u>, <u><a class="c15" href="https://dataservices.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/index.html">GFZ Data Services</a></u>, and the <u><a class="c15" href="http://www.isc.ac.uk/dataset_repository/">ISC Dataset Repository</a></u>. Code repositories like GitHub do not guarantee long-term archiving, nor do they directly assign DOIs to a given version of the content; this may cause problems when authors make changes to the repository that are not documented in the publication. Fortunately, it is easy to archive a GitHub repository in Zenodo for a DOI-citable version. <br/><br/>​​Authors must document the theory, methods and procedures used and explain the source for data and codes to generate the results. Documentation may include: (1) What each script does; (2) In which order the scripts should be run; (3) What the software/system dependencies are.<br/><br/>Licenses: A license allows another person to use data under certain conditions set by the rights holder. A <u><a class="c15" href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/">Creative Commons</a></u> (CC) license is one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work.

Questions about data and code sharing should be asked in advance of submission or posed in the Comments to the Editor.</p></li><li><p class="c4 c5 li-bullet-0"><strong>Supplementary material. </strong>Supplemental pdf files containing text and figures should be uploaded into the journal submission system. All other supplementary files (e.g., data tables - in, e.g., .csv format) should be uploaded to a relevant separate repository. Seismica recommends the <u><a class="c15" href="https://zenodo.org/communities/seismica/">Seismica</a></u><u><a class="c15" href="https://zenodo.org/communities/seismica/"> community repository in Zenodo</a></u>. </p></li><li><p class="c4 c5 li-bullet-0"><strong>Spelling and grammar. </strong>Authors must run a complete spelling and grammatical check before submission (e.g., using (free) online tools such as Grammarly). Seismica has no preference for British vs American spellings, as long as manuscripts are self-consistent throughout. If the level of writing in a submission is such that it cannot be understood by the editor, then the editor at their discretion may return to the authors for correction before the manuscript is sent out for peer review.</p></li><li><p class="c4 c5 li-bullet-0"><strong>Suggesting potential reviewers.</strong> The authors should suggest potential peer reviewers in the <em>Comments to Editor</em> box in the online submission form. Where appropriate, list reviewers who should not be contacted due to conflicts of interest, etc. Authors can help the journal improve the diversity of Seismica’s reviewer pool by including women, young scientists, and members of other underrepresented groups in their lists of suggested reviewers. Authors should suggest recommended reviewers in the relevant subject area. Where a submission focuses on a specific geographical location, we recommend that the authors offer at least one reviewer based in that region (assuming that the reviewer has a reasonable degree of expertise in the subject area). This effort ensures a broader diversity of reviewers and increases the impact of the scientific work. </p></li><li><p class="c4 c5 li-bullet-0"><strong>Submitting a manuscript for double-anonymous review.</strong> Authors may elect not to share their identities with reviewers during the review process by requesting double-anonymous review in the “Comments to the Editor” during submission. Note that remaining completely anonymous may not be possible since authors may be publicly linked to datasets they collected, or may have previously presented preliminary work at conferences with published abstracts. For double-anonymous review, it is the authors’ responsibility to anonymize their submitted manuscript file to the best of their ability; identifying data will be collected during manuscript submission but will not be passed on to reviewers with the manuscript file. The submitted manuscript PDF should not include author names and affiliations, an author contributions statement, a data and code availability statement, or acknowledgements. However, a statement on data/code availability should be included in a cover letter or <em>Comments to the Editor</em>. This information will be used to confirm that the work is in compliance with Seismica’s policies on open data, but will not be shared with reviewers. If the article is accepted, author names and affiliations, author contributions, a data and code availability statement, and acknowledgements are required in the post-acceptance formatted files submitted for typesetting. If authors choose to use the Seismica LaTeX submission template, it has an “anonymous” option which will produce a pdf without author names, affiliations, and contributions. </p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header" id="peer-review"><h2 class="mb-0"><button aria-controls="peer-review" aria-expanded="false" class="btn btn-lg btn-light btn-block collapsed" data-target="#peer-review" data-toggle="collapse" type="button"><span class="pull-left">Peer review</span></button></h2></div><div aria-labelledby="peer-review" class="collapse" data-parent="#acc_guidelines-for-authors" id="peer-review"><div class="card-body"><p class="c4">To save time for authors and peer-reviewers, only those papers that seem likely to meet our editorial criteria should be sent for formal review.

Guidance may also be given on whether the manuscript may be submitted as a different publication type.</p><p class="c4">At the author’s request, manuscripts can instead be subjected to anonymous (i.e., double-anonymous) peer review. Moreover, the reviewers can decide whether or not to reveal their identity in their review. If you wish to have your manuscript reviewed anonymously, please state this in the “Comments to the Editor” box. Note that the responsibility is with the author to ensure they have appropriately blinded their manuscript such that it is free from identifying metadata (see <u><a class="c15" href="https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/author-guidelines#submission-and-formatting-checklist">Submission and fo</a></u><u><a class="c15" href="https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/author-guidelines#submission-and-formatting-checklist">rmatting c</a></u><u><a class="c15" href="https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/author-guidelines#submission-and-formatting-checklist">hecklist</a></u>). Research has shown that double-anonymous review may decrease reviewer bias which preferentially impacts authors from under-represented groups and early career authors.  However, some work has suggested that reviewers may be biased against authors due to their selection of double-anonymous review mode. Seismica’s authors and reviewers are asked to be aware of this potential for bias, and consider selecting double-anonymous review as a means to familiarize the research community with the potential positive benefits of this review mode. </p><p class="c4">Manuscripts judged to be of potential interest to our readership are sent for formal review, typically to 2 reviewers, although additional reviewers may be sought if found necessary by the handling editor(s). </p><p class="c4">The authors should suggest potential peer reviewers in the <em>Comments to Editor</em> box in the online submission form. Where appropriate, list reviewers who should not be contacted due to conflicts of interest, etc. Authors can help the journal improve the diversity of Seismica’s reviewer pool by including women, young scientists, and members of other underrepresented groups in their lists of suggested reviewers. Authors should suggest recommended reviewers in the relevant subject area.

Seismica will normally expect a revised version of the manuscript, together with a rebuttal letter, to be submitted within 6 months of receiving the peer review comments. </p><p class="c4">Peer review reports and rebuttal letters will be published online alongside the published paper if the manuscript is accepted. If a manuscript is rejected, the process remains confidential.
