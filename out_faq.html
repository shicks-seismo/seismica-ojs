Open Access publishing  is sometimes criticized as being less inclusive and accessible due to the very high author processing charges (APCs) charged by some hybrid and Gold Open Access journals. Seismica is run by a large, dedicated team of unpaid volunteers passionate about making the publishing landscape more equitable and fair in seismology and earthquake science. Because Seismica is a Diamond Open-Access journal, we do not charge for publishing or reading papers. This reflects our mission to make the products of our research accessible to global stakeholders.  We would love you to be part of this like-minded community! </p></div></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header" id="heading02"><h2 class="mb-0"><button aria-controls="collapse02" aria-expanded="false" class="btn btn-lg btn-light btn-block collapsed" data-target="#collapse02" data-toggle="collapse" type="button"><span class="pull-left">Is Seismica in direct competition with society-led journals?</span></button></h2></div><div aria-labelledby="heading02" class="collapse" data-parent="#acc_0" id="collapse02"><div class="card-body"><p class="c3"> No. Non-profit society journals continue to offer excellent publishing options for scientists in our field.

Finally, manuscripts can be reviewed anonymously (i.e., double-blind) at the author's request.
